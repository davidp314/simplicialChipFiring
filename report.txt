Conjecture:

Let S be a simplicial complex of dimension d.  Conjecture: S is a tree with H_{d-1}(S)=0
if and only if 0 is a minimal winning degree in dimension d-1.

Partial argument:

Suppose that all (d-1)-divisors of degree 0 are winnable (which might be different
from 0 be a minimal winning degree---we don't know).  Then since the group of
divisors of degree 0 modulo the image of the Laplacian is isomorphic to the
torsion part of the critical group and the critical group is isomorphic to the
F/im(reduced Laplacian), we know that the determinant of the reduced Laplacian
is 1 (otherwise, it's smith normal form would demonstrate torsion in
F/im(red_Lap) and hence in the critical group.  We have the following equation
for the tree number

t(d) = sum_{T: T a d-dim'l spanning tree of S) |H_{d-1}(T)|^2
     = |H_{d-2}(S)|^2/|H_{d-2}(R)|^2 det(red_Lap_{d-1})

where R is any (d-1)-dimensional tree.  In our case, the determinant is 1.  

Next, suppose that |H_{d-2}(S)| = |H_{d-2}(R)|.  (For example, we could take
H_{d-2}(S)=0, or consider the case where d=2, and the complex is connected.)
Then we know t(d) = 1 and S has a unique tree (the first sum has only one
summand).  We would like to say that S is this tree.  Scott gives an argument
under the condition that S is acyclic in codimension 1.  Now, we know that the
torsion part of the critical group in dimension d-1 is 0, and we know that the
critical group of dimension d-1 surjects on to the homology group in dimension
d-1.  Is there are way we could say that 0 being a winning degree forces the d-1
homology group to be finite?  (See Scott and Liam's paper where they prove
something similar, at least in dimension d=2.)

At any rate, it is interesting to look for a non-tree S such that every divisor
of degree 0 is winnable.  Such an S would need to have |H_{d-2}(S)| !=
|H_{d-2}(T)| for every (d-1)-tree T, and the torsion part of its critical group
would have to be 0.
